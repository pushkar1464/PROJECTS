The aim of the project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. This is crucial
from the bank's as well as customer's perspective. The banks cannot afford to lose their customers money to
fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions. The dataset
contains transactions made by European credit cardholders in the year 2023. The positive class account for 50% of
all transactions. We need to take check for the data imbalance while building the model and come up with the best
model by trying various algorithms.
